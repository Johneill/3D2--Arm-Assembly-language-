Introduction:
The purpose of this lab is to encourage you to become familiar with interrupt handling. The concepts behind interrupts and interrupt handling mark a big break with the relatively simple programming model you have used until now. Interrupts are used very extensively and form part of virtually every computer system. In addition, they are a fundamental component of operating systems.

Task:
The task is to set up a timed interrupt exactly every 5 ms (milliseconds) and to use it to make the RGB LED (it's actually a  package of three LEDs) at the top right of the board change colour in rotating sequence. Each colour should light for exactly one second before going on to the next. Did I mention that the timing has to be exact?
